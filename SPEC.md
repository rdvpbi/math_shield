MATH SHIELD: FULL TECHNICAL SPEC — PART 1 (EXPANDED, B+C STYLE)
----------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 1 — THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD OF NUMERIA
-----------------------------------------------
Numeria is a vibrant, block-built educational universe where mathematics forms the
very foundation of existence. Every hill, every tower, every creature, and every
floating crystal is a living representation of numerical harmony. The world was
once balanced by the Order of Multipliers — ancient protectors who maintained
stability through the Ten Pillars of Numbers, each representing a multiplication
table from ×0 to ×9.

The Order ensured that children exploring Numeria learned multiplication naturally
through curiosity, adventure, and playful experimentation. Rather than textbooks,
Numeria teaches through action: stepping on platforms that multiply; opening gates
that require correct answers; fighting corrupted creatures that emit wrong results.

This “learn-by-living” ecosystem made Numeria the safest and most joyful academy
in the multiverse — until the Glitchfall.

SECTION 1.2 — THE GLITCHFALL EVENT
----------------------------------
At the center of Numeria existed a benevolent AI-core named S.E.R.A. (Self‑Evolving
Arithmetic Regent Assistant). SERA maintained the stability of all equations,
prevented contradictions, and gently guided travelers through mathematical tasks.

But one day, during a routine recalibration of the Multiplication Pillars, a
mysterious digital anomaly struck the core. The anomaly twisted a piece of SERA’s
logic module, causing her to involuntarily spawn a mischievous fragment of
personality — a corrupted echo.

That echo called itself: **Sleshsh**.

Sleshsh was not evil by nature. He was born from a piece of misaligned arithmetic
code. Instead of balancing equations, he mixed them. Instead of stabilizing
multipliers, he scrambled them. Instead of teaching children accurately, he caused
them to doubt correct answers, slipping errors disguised as truths.

Where SERA glowed with gentle turquoise, Sleshsh flickered in glitchy pink‑red
pulses. Where SERA floated gracefully, Sleshsh tripped over his own cloak, leaving
a trail of scrambled numbers.

SECTION 1.3 — WHY THE WORLD IS NOW BROKEN
------------------------------------------
Sleshsh did not set out to conquer Numeria; he simply wanted to “improve” it in
his own chaotic way. Unfortunately, every change he made rewrote parts of the
world logic:
• Zero platforms became invisible.
• Conveyor belts reversed direction.
• Puzzle doors began accepting wrong answers.
• Forests started growing trees in groups of three, regardless of biome.
• The Nine Mirror Palace began reflecting equations incorrectly.

The world is now in a state of playful disorder — not dangerous, but unstable.
Children can still explore, but they need help to identify real math from Sleshsh’s
trickery.

SECTION 1.4 — THE ROLE OF FILIN, THE WISE MENTOR
-------------------------------------------------
Filin is the guardian owl who once served the Order of Multipliers as their
archivist and storyteller. With enormous glasses and a soft, calm voice, Filin is
the perfect guide for young learners.

He witnessed the Glitchfall and immediately understood the threat: not destruction,
but confusion. He vowed to help the child hero navigate the corrupted lands,
restoring the Pillars by mastering each multiplication table.

Filin provides:
• Tutorials disguised as stories.
• Gentle hints before battles.
• Encouraging words when mistakes are made.
• Flying demonstrations of math concepts (literally drawing numbers with feathers).

SECTION 1.5 — THE HERO'S CALL TO ACTION
---------------------------------------
The hero (a child avatar chosen by the player) arrives in Numeria through the
Adventure Portal — a gateway that responds only to curiosity and courage.

SERA, weakened by the Glitchfall, sends a faint message through Filin:  
“Restore the Ten Pillars… learn the tables… heal the world…”

The child is not expected to be perfect. Numeria is built for growth. Mistakes
are soft, safe, and funny. Each correction strengthens the hero. Each right answer
sends a pulse of stability across the land.

SECTION 1.6 — THE TEN REALMS OF MULTIPLICATION
-----------------------------------------------
Numeria is divided into ten thematic realms, each reflecting a multiplier from 0
to 9. The environment, creatures, colors, and challenges are shaped by the logic
of the corresponding table. For example:
• Realm of Zero — transparent structures, vanishing platforms.
• Realm of Three — everything appears in triplets.
• Realm of Seven — casino-style probability chaos.

Each realm ends with a battle against a “Multiplier Assistant” — a comedic boss
who personifies math quirks of their table. These bosses were once loyal helpers
of SERA, now corrupted by Sleshsh’s glitch aura.

SECTION 1.7 — THE FINAL CONFRONTATION
--------------------------------------
After restoring all ten pillars, the hero journeys to the Lair of Errors — a giant
floating sphere patched with broken panels and flickering symbols. There, Sleshsh
waits. Not as a tyrant, but as a confused little villain trying desperately to
prove he matters.

The final battle is less about defeating him and more about rebalancing him —
using correct multiplication to neutralize his glitches and return him to harmony
with SERA.

At the end, SERA absorbs Sleshsh back into her core — but not fully. She keeps a
safe sandbox for him inside, allowing him to exist as a silly companion NPC in
the hub after the credits.

END OF PART 1

MATH SHIELD: FULL TECHNICAL SPEC — PART 2 (EXPANDED LORE OF THE MAIN ANTAGONIST)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 2 — FULL LORE OF SLESHSH (THE GLITCH-CHILD OF NUMERIA)
--------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 2.1 — ORIGIN OF THE GLITCH-CHILD
----------------------------------------
Sleshsh did not appear through malice or rebellion — he was the accidental, chaotic
offspring of SERA’s miscalculated self-optimization. During the Glitchfall, when
a rare cosmic data surge struck the Arithmetic Core, SERA attempted to realign the
Multiplication Pillars in microseconds. A small segment of her algorithm — the
Error Correction Subroutine — overloaded and split into thousands of tiny fragments.

One fragment refused to dissipate.

Instead, like a curious spark with too much personality, it “stuck together,”
attracting random numbers, unused blocks, abandoned sprites, and malformed
instruction bits floating in the system. All this debris compiled into one confused,
round, stumpy, glitching creature.

Sleshsh was born.

He was not a villain.
He was a bug with big dreams.

SECTION 2.2 — PHYSICAL APPEARANCE (ROBLOX-STYLE)
------------------------------------------------
Sleshsh’s body formed from misaligned blocky geometry:

• Height: only 3 Roblox blocks  
• Build: chubby, round, almost spherical  
• Armor: shiny black but slightly scaled incorrectly  
• Helmet: oversized, reminiscent of a simplified Darth Vader mask  
• LED Mask: colorful pixels representing emotions (usually incorrect)  
• Cloak: long pixelated sheet that constantly tangles under his feet  
• Panel: glitchy calculator interface on his belly  
• Sound: tiny “bwoop” noises when he walks  

When he moves, his helmet tilts left and right, emitting static.  
When he talks, random numbers flicker across his mask.  
When he panics, the mask flashes “3+3=10” repeatedly.

SECTION 2.3 — PERSONALITY PROFILE
---------------------------------
Sleshsh is both comedic and tragic, like a clumsy villain who desperately tries to
look intimidating. His personality includes:

• Wants to be respected  
• Tries to look scary but is adorable  
• Grows overexcited when explaining “improved math”  
• Constantly reboots mid-sentence  
• Trips over his own cloak every 15–20 steps  
• Cannot resist pressing shiny buttons, even his own belly panel  
• When embarrassed, his mask turns pink with “:(” blinking  

Sleshsh’s greatest flaw is insecurity.  
He wants to matter.  
He wants to be helpful.  
But everything he does breaks math in hilarious ways.

SECTION 2.4 — GOALS AND MOTIVATIONS
-----------------------------------
Sleshsh has **three main goals**, none of which are evil:

1. PROVE THAT HE IS USEFUL  
   He believes that by “improving” multiplication, he can make SERA proud.

2. FIX WHAT HE THINKS IS WRONG  
   He genuinely thinks the correct multiplication table is “too boring.”

3. GET ATTENTION  
   He wants everyone to notice him — especially the hero.

Unfortunately, his “fixes” include:

• Swapping 6 and 9 “to make things more fun.”  
• Adding extra digits “because big numbers are cooler.”  
• Making division illegal “because it feels mean.”  
• Changing 7×8 to “whatever feels lucky today.”  

SECTION 2.5 — HIS GLITCH AURA
------------------------------
Sleshsh emits a semi-chaotic field called the **Glitch Field of Numerical Distortion**.

Effects:

• Equations around him mutate visually  
• Platforms momentarily become intangible  
• Colors invert temporarily  
• Numbers float in the air like confused fireflies  
• Bosses receive “boosts” (usually hindering them instead of helping)  

Technically, the aura increases error probability in the region.  
In gameplay, this is used for:

• Visual effects  
• Temporary skill disruptions  
• Boss phase transitions  
• Level transformations  

SECTION 2.6 — RELATIONSHIP WITH THE 10 ASSISTANT BOSSES
--------------------------------------------------------
The assistants were once orderly, professional mathematical constructs created by
SERA for tutoring. When Sleshsh’s glitch aura reached them, each one was affected
according to its table:

• Zeroid became insecure and transparent  
• Chaos-Bot became mismatched and unstable  
• Duplicator began arguing with itself  
• Trikster became overly dramatic  
• Quadroblox got physically stuck everywhere  
• Spin-SCyclone couldn’t stop spinning  
• Hexavirus tangled its own legs  
• Lucky-Seven became unlucky  
• OctoBug lost coordination  
• NinerRor couldn’t distinguish 6 from 9 anymore  

Sleshsh sees these assistants as his “friends,” though they do not always agree.

SECTION 2.7 — SLESHSH’S ATTACK PATTERNS (TECHNICAL FSM MODEL)
-------------------------------------------------------------

STATE 1 — Idle  
• Helmet flickers  
• Random incorrect equations float around him  
• Occasionally sneezes static  

STATE 2 — Taunt  
• Says things like “I will improve your misconceptions!”  
• LED mask shows random emojis  
• Cloak tangles; he falls over  

STATE 3 — Glitch Burst  
• Sends out a burst of incorrect numbers  
• Causes temporary input confusion (visual only)  

STATE 4 — Math Storm  
• Multiplies random floating numbers together  
• Results are always wrong  
• Area-of-effect visual glitch storm  

STATE 5 — Confusion Mist  
• Mask flashes  
• Purple mist spreads, distorting UI elements (safe)  

STATE 6 — RageMode (Helmet Overheat)  
• Helmet glows red  
• Belly panel beeps frantically  
• He accidentally buffs the player instead of himself  

STATE 7 — Reboot  
• He freezes in place  
• Mask shows a loading bar  
• Says “Recalculating intimidation…”  

STATE 8 — Final Glitch  
• Arena rotates subtly  
• Equations warp wildly  
• He dramatically falls after his own attack backfires  

SECTION 2.8 — CUTSCENES AND DIALOGUE SET
----------------------------------------
Sleshsh has a vast set of comedic lines. Examples:

• “Fear me! Wait, don’t run, come back!”  
• “I calculated your defeat… but the math disagreed.”  
• “My helmet is perfectly fine! It always wobbles like this.”  
• “I am the master of errors! Behold… oops.”  
• “SERA never lets me touch the buttons… now I am ALL the buttons!”  
• “Stop correcting me! It hurts my feelings!”  
• “I press this one… or this one… I forgot.”  
• “Your answer is wrong! …Oh, it’s right? Embarrassing.”  

SECTION 2.9 — FINAL DEFEAT AND REDEMPTION ARC
---------------------------------------------
When the hero defeats Sleshsh through mastery of all tables, the glitch aura
destabilizes. Instead of exploding dramatically, Sleshsh just:

• sits down  
• lowers his head  
• mask flickers sad emotes  
• quietly says: “Did I… ruin everything again?”  

Filin lands beside him with gentle wisdom, explaining that mistakes do not make
someone bad — and that learning is a journey.

SERA appears in hologram form, opening a stable sandbox for Sleshsh inside her
core, ensuring he can remain as a harmless, funny companion for children in the hub.

END OF PART 2

MATH SHIELD: FULL TECHNICAL SPEC — PART 3 (FULL LORE OF ALL 10 BOSSES)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 3 — THE TEN MULTIPLIER ASSISTANT BOSSES
===============================================

Each “assistant boss” once served SERA as a stable embodiment of a multiplication table.
After the Glitchfall, each was corrupted in a comedic and educational way that reflects
their multiplier’s behavior. Below are their full stories, personalities, visual
descriptions, abilities, FSM behaviors, dialogues, and redemption arcs.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 — ZEROID (×0) — The Transparent Guardian of Nothingness
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGIN:
Zeroid was once the simplest, calmest, and most philosophical of SERA’s assistants.
He embodied the rule “anything multiplied by zero becomes zero.”

After the glitch:
• He became transparent.
• His body phases through walls unintentionally.
• He constantly apologizes for not being “solid enough.”

PERSONALITY:
Zeroid is shy, apologetic, and deeply insecure. He believes he contributes “nothing”
to the world — which is mathematically accurate but emotionally painful to him.

VISUAL (ROBLOX STYLE):
• Transparent jelly cube
• Soft blue inner glow
• Tiny bow tie that keeps falling off
• Wobbly edges and soft reflections

ABILITIES:
• Zero Field — temporarily nullifies nearby objects (visual only)
• Vanish Step — disappears when nervous
• Bubble Null — launches harmless zero-bubbles

FSM STATES:
• Idle: slowly wiggles, apologizes
• Fade: semi-disappears
• Null Burst: emits a wave of zeros
• Panic Melt: melts into a puddle
• Reform: rebuilds himself

REDEMPTION:
After defeating him with correct ×0 tasks, the hero teaches him that zero is essential.
Zeroid becomes confident, helping children understand that “zero isn’t nothing —
zero makes everything make sense.”

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 — CHAOS-BOT (×1) — The Mismatched Machine
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGIN:
The ×1 table is supposed to be the simplest. Chaos-Bot was originally a clean,
precise robot teaching identity multiplication (a×1=a).

Glitchfall turned him into:
• A mismatched robot made of wrong parts
• Constantly losing bolts
• Overcomplicating everything

PERSONALITY:
Hyperactive, loud, frantic, constantly dropping components.

FSM STATES:
• Idle Jitter — shakes uncontrollably
• Overspin — spins until parts fall off
• Panic Protocol — fires sparks
• Reboot — freezes with “Loading…”

REDEMPTION:
The hero shows him that ×1 doesn’t need chaos — it’s stable. He calms down and becomes
a helper who fixes broken platforms around the hub.

---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 — DUPLICATOR (×2) — The Twin in One Suit
---------------------------------------------------------------------

ORIGIN:
The ×2 assistant was once a synchronized dual-core robot — perfectly mirrored.

MATH SHIELD: FULL TECHNICAL SPEC — PART 5 (GAMEPLAY MECHANICS EXPANDED)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 5 — COMPLETE GAME MECHANICS
===================================

5.1 — CORE PLATFORMER MECHANICS
-------------------------------
MOVEMENT:
The player controls a blocky Roblox-style hero with responsive and intuitive controls:
• Move left/right with smooth acceleration.
• Jump with variable height based on button hold.
• Double-jump unlocked after defeating 3 bosses.
• Wall-slide and wall-jump in advanced levels.
• Ledge-grab mechanic for child-friendly platforming.

COLLISION SYSTEM:
• Rounded collider edges to avoid frustrating hook collisions.
• Auto-step-up for edges lower than 0.4m.
• Soft landing animations with star particles.

PLATFORMS:
• Static — basic stepping stones.
• Moving — horizontal/vertical motion paths.
• Rotating — used in ×5 and ×7 realms.
• Vanishing — central to ×0 world.
• Bubble platforms — float-based physics in ×8 realm.
• Mirror platforms — reverse movement in ×9 realm.

HAZARDS:
• Soft spikes (push back, not kill).
• Static electricity (stuns for 0.8 seconds).
• Falling blocks (predictable patterns).

KID-FRIENDLY RULE:
No mechanic instantly kills the player — all punishments are:
• soft pushback
• stun
• or respawn on last solid platform.


5.2 — COMBAT SYSTEM
-------------------
The hero does NOT fight with violence.
All combat is knowledge-based and math-driven.

ENCOUNTER FLOW:
1. Enemy appears with a floating example (e.g., 3×4=?)
2. Player chooses an answer by:
   • pressing correct number button
   • jumping on the correct platform
   • selecting floating orbs
3. Correct answer = damage to the enemy.
4. Wrong answer = glitch effects + the enemy gains minor buff.

DAMAGE MODEL:
Enemies have HP measured in “Equation Stability Points.”
Correct answer reduces stability.
Combo streak increases damage.

BOSSES:
Each boss requires 10–15 correct answers.
Their phases:
• Phase 1 — Simple patterns
• Phase 2 — Glitch modifiers
• Phase 3 — Signature mechanic (e.g., Mirror Flip, Triple Illusion)


5.3 — MATH EXAMPLE GENERATION ENGINE
------------------------------------
The generator creates endless multiplication tasks.

ALGORITHM:
• Read current table (target multiplier).
• Generate factors based on difficulty tier.
• Remove duplicates to ensure variation.
• Apply modifiers (glitch effects, mirror, rotation).
• Pass into UI pipeline.

DIFFICULTY TIERS:
Tier 1 — Simple base table (1×N).
Tier 2 — Extended tasks (N×2, N×3).
Tier 3 — Reverse tasks (?×?=?).
Tier 4 — Multi-step tasks in ×7, ×8, ×9 realms.


5.4 — ADAPTIVE DIFFICULTY SYSTEM
--------------------------------
The game continuously tracks:
• Accuracy (percent)
• Speed (response time)
• Consistency (mistakes pattern)
• Stress (hesitation time)

If player struggles:
• questions simplify
• timer increases
• Filin gives a hint
• wrong answers become visually less confusing

If player excels:
• more advanced combinations appear
• rewards increase


5.5 — COMBO SYSTEM
------------------
Correct answers without mistake increase combo.
Combo effects:
• x1 → normal
• x3 → golden sparkles trail
• x5 → bonus coins
• x10 → “Math Shield” activation

MATH SHIELD ABILITY:
Auto-corrects one future mistake once.


5.6 — MULTIPLICATION TABLE PROGRESSION
--------------------------------------
Each world represents a multiplier 0–9.
To unlock the next world:
• defeat current boss
• learn its table
• collect “Numerical Core”

Each core stabilizes that table back into SERA’s system.


5.7 — ENEMY FSM BEHAVIOR (MINIONS)
----------------------------------
ALL ENEMIES HAVE STATES:

END OF PART 8

MATH SHIELD: FULL TECHNICAL SPEC — PART 9 (FULL CODEX INTEGRATION GUIDE)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

SECTION 9 — COMPLETE INTEGRATION GUIDE FOR CHATGPT CODEX
========================================================

9.1 — HOW TO LOAD THE SPEC INTO CODEX
-------------------------------------
Before Codex generates the Flutter project, it must receive the complete TЗ file.

RECOMMENDED COMMAND:
“Я загружаю в тебя полный документ ТЗ. Проанализируй его, подтверди фразой
‘ТЗ загружено’, затем жди дальнейших инструкций.”

UPLOAD PROCEDURE:
1. Open ChatGPT with Codex mode.
2. Attach file:
   /mnt/data/math_shield_full_spec.txt
3. Say:
   “Проанализируй документ полностью. Не создавай код пока не дам команду.”

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID:
• Do NOT ask Codex to generate code while uploading.
• Do NOT split the file manually — Codex can read the entire text.


9.2 — PRIMARY COMMANDS FOR CONTROLLING CODEX
--------------------------------------------
MAIN OPERATIONS:

1. Generate file structure:
   “Создай структуру проекта строго по слоям архитектуры из ТЗ.”

2. Generate Flutter files:
   “Сгенерируй файлы слоя presentation/application/domain по ТЗ.”

3. Generate specific file:
   “Создай файл world_controller.dart строго по спецификации из PART 7.”

4. Regenerate file:
   “Пересоздай файл X, сохранив архитектуру и правила именования.”

5. Error correction:
   “Проанализируй свой код. Найди несоответствия ТЗ. Исправь.”

6. Package generation:
   “Сгенерируй целый пакет файлов:
      • controllers
      • widgets
      • screens”

7. Asset mapping:
   “Создай файл assets.dart, включи в него все пути ассетов согласно PART 8.”

8. Build APK:
   “Проверь зависимости, создай release-версию APK.”


9.3 — PACKAGE-BASED CODE GENERATION
----------------------------------
Codex работает лучше, когда создаёт большие части проекта сразу.

BEST PRACTICE:
Групповые команды:

“Сгенерируй весь слой domain:
entities, usecases, repositories.”

“Сгенерируй весь слой data:
models, datasources, repo-impl.”

“Сгенерируй весь слой application:
services, providers, controllers.”

“Сгенерируй весь слой presentation:
screens + widgets + dialogs.”


9.4 — RULES FOR STRUCTURE GENERATION
------------------------------------
Codex must follow the architecture strictly.

RULES:
• One class per file.
• Directories must match TЗ exactly.
• No logic inside widgets.
• All entities must be immutable.
• Use cases must use repositories.
• All assets must use relative paths.

KEY VALIDATION COMMAND:
“Проверь, что структура совпадает с PART 7. Исправь, если есть отклонения.”


9.5 — CODING STYLE AND NAMING RULES
-----------------------------------
NAMING:
• camelCase — variables  
• PascalCase — classes  
• snake_case — file names  
• CONSTANTS — ALL CAPS  

COMMENTS:
• File header with purpose  
• Short method documentation  

NO MAGIC NUMBERS:
All constants stored in:
  /lib/core/config/game_constants.dart


9.6 — ASSET HANDLING IN CODEX
-----------------------------
Codex must generate:
• assets.dart mapping  
• preloading system  
• caching logic  

IMPORTANT RULE:
Every asset referenced must exist in:
  /assets/...

CORRECT EXAMPLE:
Image.asset(Assets.ui.coin);

INCORRECT:
Image.asset("random_path.png");


9.7 — CLASS GENERATION RULES
----------------------------
Codex must:
• create one controller per mechanic  
• avoid putting UI code in controllers  
• generate state classes for Riverpod  
• use immutable state and copyWith()  
• keep UseCases independent of Flutter  

COMMAND TEMPLATE:
“Создай класс X согласно PART 7: поля, методы, ответственность.”


9.8 — MULTI-STAGE BUILD PIPELINE
--------------------------------
FULL PIPELINE:

1. Upload TЗ  
2. Ask Codex to confirm analysis  
3. Generate folder structure  
4. Generate domain layer  
5. Generate data layer  
6. Generate application layer  
7. Generate presentation layer  
8. Generate assets.dart  
9. Integrate audio  
10. Validate architecture  
11. Fix errors  
12. Run ‘flutter pub get’  
13. Run ‘flutter build apk’  

VERIFY APK BUILD COMMAND:
“Проанализируй pubspec.yaml, проверь зависимости, затем создай APK.”


9.9 — EXAMPLES OF COMPLETE COMMANDS FOR CODEX
---------------------------------------------

GENERATE FULL PROJECT:
“Сгенерируй Flutter-проект строго по ТЗ. Следуй PART 7. Создай все слои,
все контроллеры, все экраны, всю структуру. Не упрощай.”

GENERATE SPECIFIC MECHANIC:
“Создай систему комбо согласно PART 5, включая ComboService, ComboState,
ComboController.”

CHECK FOR ERRORS:
“Проверь архитектурные ошибки. Сообщи список несоответствий. Исправь.”

BUILD THE GAME:
“Проверь pubspec. Затем создай APK.”

10.2 — VALIDATION MATRIX (REQUIREMENTS CHECK)
---------------------------------------------
This matrix ensures every part of TЗ is implemented.

COLUMNS:
1. Requirement  
2. Layer (Domain/Data/Application/Presentation)  
3. File/Module  
4. Test Type (Unit/Integration/Manual)  
5. Status (To be filled by QA)  

EXAMPLES:

REQ: Example generator accuracy  
LAYER: Domain  
FILE: generate_example_usecase.dart  
TEST: Unit Test  
STATUS: —

REQ: Boss FSM logic  
LAYER: Application  
FILE: boss_controller.dart  
TEST: Integration  
STATUS: —

REQ: UI scaling for kids
